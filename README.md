# Welcome to my Membrane Assisted Panel Model

This project looks to give engineers and researchers the ability to estimate the cooling capacity and membrane temperature of a membrane-assisted cooling panel. It also provides a framework that will allow for the integration of the model within a Building Performance Simulation tool. This software is open-source and free, and was originally developed by Denon Sheppard at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, Canada. Please see the project wiki for more information about the project, including model instillation and usage, or follow the links below.
