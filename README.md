# Welcome to my Membrane Assisted Panel Model

This project looks to give engineers and researchers the ability to estimate the cooling capacity and membrane temperature of a membrane-assisted cooling panel. It also provides a framework that will allow for the integration of the model within a Building Performance Simulation tool. This software is open-source and free, and was originally developed by Denon Sheppard at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, Canada.


##Installation

Installation instructions for the Python only thermophysics model that can be used to determine the membrane temperature and cooling capacity of different panel designs can be found here:
