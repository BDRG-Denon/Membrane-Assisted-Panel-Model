# Welcome to my Membrane Assisted Panel Model

The model looks to give engineers and researchers the ability to estimate the cooling capacity and membrane temperature of a membrane assisted cooling panel. I also propose a framework that will allow the model to run within a Building Performance Simulation. This software is open-source and free, and was originally developed by Denon Sheppard at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, Canada.

Please see the project wiki for more information about the project, including model instillation and usage.
